# Automated Penetration Testing Tool

This automated penetration testing tool is designed to streamline the process of conducting security assessments and penetration tests on target systems. It offers a wide range of features and functionalities to assist security professionals in identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting weaknesses, and assessing overall system security.

# Features

```
Network Scanning: Perform network scans to identify live hosts and open ports using the powerful nmap tool.

Service Enumeration: Enumerate services running on target systems to gather detailed information about available services and potential vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability Exploitation: Exploit identified vulnerabilities using custom commands or scripts, facilitating further penetration into target systems.

Privilege Escalation: Execute privilege escalation techniques to elevate user privileges and gain deeper access to target systems.

Credential Extraction: Extract credentials from target systems using specified tools or methods, aiding in further unauthorized access.

Report Generation: Generate comprehensive reports summarizing penetration testing findings, facilitating documentation and communication of identified vulnerabilities and recommendations.

Interactive Shell: Open interactive shell sessions for real-time exploration and exploitation of target systems.

Web Application Testing: Conduct security assessments of web applications to uncover vulnerabilities and weaknesses that may pose security risks.

Password Cracking: Attempt to crack passwords to identify weak or compromised credentials that could be exploited by attackers.

Wireless Network Testing: Assess the security of wireless networks to identify potential vulnerabilities and strengthen overall network security posture.

File Integrity Checking: Perform integrity checks on critical files and directories to detect unauthorized modifications or tampering.

Exploit Database Search: Search for relevant exploits in the Exploit Database to leverage known vulnerabilities during penetration testing activities.

Temporary File Cleanup: Automatically clean up temporary files and artifacts generated during testing to maintain system cleanliness and security.
